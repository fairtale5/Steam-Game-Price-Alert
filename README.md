## How It Works

1. **Game Addition**: Extracts `app_id` from Steam store links and fetches game details
2. **Price Monitoring**: Fetches current prices from Steam API using country/language settings
3. **Price History**: Automatically saves all price checks to SQLite database
4. **Sale Detection**: 
   - Compares current price with historical data
   - Checks against user-defined price targets (if configured)
   - Detects any discounts or price drops
5. **Historical Low**: Compares current price with all historical prices to identify record lows
6. **Notifications**: Sends rich Discord embeds with:
   - Game name, image, and store link
   - Current price and discount percentage
   - Historical low indicator (when applicable)
7. **Duplicate Prevention**: Tracks active sales to prevent spam notifications
8. **Data Persistence**: All data saved to database and JSON files for reliability

## FAQ

**Q: How do I add multiple games?**  
A: Use option 2 in the main menu to add games. You can add multiple games in sequence, or use option 3 to scan multiple games at once.

**Q: Can I change how often prices are checked?**  
A: Yes, modify the `SLEEP_TIME` constant in `main.py` (default: 3600 seconds = 1 hour).

**Q: Not receiving Discord notifications?**  
A: Verify your webhook URL is correct, the webhook is enabled in your Discord server, and check the `debug.log` file for error messages.

**Q: What is the "Historical Low" feature?**  
A: The bot tracks all price changes over time. When a price matches or beats the lowest price ever recorded, it shows a special indicator. This helps you identify the best deals!

**Q: Can I view game information without scanning?**  
A: Yes! Use option 7 "View detailed game info" to see comprehensive information about any game in your watchlist, including reviews, tags, and release dates.

**Q: How does price history tracking work?**  
A: Every time the bot checks a game's price (during scans or when viewing current prices), it saves the price to the database. This creates a historical record that enables the "Lowest Price Ever" feature.

**Q: Will the bot work if I restart my computer?**  
A: The bot saves all data (games, settings, price history) to files and database. You can restart anytime and continue where you left off. However, you'll need to manually restart the scanning process.
