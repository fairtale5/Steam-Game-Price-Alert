## Features

- **Sale Monitoring**: Automatically checks game prices via Steam API hourly
- **Discord Notifications**: Sends alerts to your Discord channel when sales are detected
- **User Preferences**: Stores country code, language, and Discord webhook settings
- **Game Database**: Maintains game information in SQLite
- **Sale Tracking**: Prevents duplicate notifications by tracking active sales
- **Scan Multiple Games**: Track multiple game sales at once instead of just one per session.
- **Price Target Alerts**: Customize notifications for specific price thresholds or any discount
- **Clear Screen System**: Automatically refreshes display after each question for better readability

## How It Works

1. Fetches game details from Steam API using the game's `app_id`
2. Compares current price with previous price to detect sales
3. Checks against user-defined price targets when configured
4. Sends Discord notification with game name, price, discount, and image
5. Manages notification frequency to prevent Discord webhook rate limiting
6. Saves sale details to prevent duplicate notifications
7. Removes games from tracking when sales end
8. Refreshes interface after each user interaction for better readability
